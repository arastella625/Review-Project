<b>Summary:</b><br>
This project was built in order to keep track of our grades for URI's CSC 212 course as the semester progresses. Over the span of 2 weeks, our group has worked diligently to prepare this program. The program follows the <i>points-achieved grading system</i> that the course uses. We utilized a variety of good programming principles in order to build this project, including a <code>class</code> structure, various <code>while</code> and <code>for</code> loops, thoughtful class-method implemenetations, vectors, file processing functions, and conditional logic. Overall, it was a good review of many C++ concepts that leaves us with a useful program to keep us informed of our grade as the semester progresses.
